# RPS Challenge

This is my attempt at the RPS Challenge. You can find the original readme in the ORIGINAL_README.md file.


Approach
=========
My approach to this challenge is to sketch out a model of how the MVC domain will work together. From there I will set up RSPEC and write my feature test before moving onto a unit test and then start to code. I'm hoping to have only one controlling class that will be instantiated at the start of the game and weverything will run through there. I'm not going to focus on design and HTML formatting as my focus right now is having an effective model and clear logic.

Reflection
===========
